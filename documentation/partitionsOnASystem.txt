// This will contain details about partitions in the way that I get to understand them

o Partitions
- On a disk, which is a long array of 0/1 symbols, we can separate those into smaller parts, since the word PARTition.
- The computing device needs to know where on a disk the new partition starts. That is to mean, from which symbol onward the new partition is to be read (i.e.: from the 100th symbol onward). 
- It also needs to know how big the partition is.(i.e: how many symbols in total does that partition have)
- Partitions allow creating regions on a disk (HDD,SSD, etc if others) to be managed separately. 
- The details about a partition, like it's starting point and size is stored in a partition table.
