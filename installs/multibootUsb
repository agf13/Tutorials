o Making a multiboot usb
For this, I will copy-paste the commands and try to provide an explanation to the best of my understanding.

//The device will be prepared in this guide using the traditional msdos layout.
//We will install grub bootloader in both EFI and legagy mode (BIOS) to be able to start in both UEFI and BIOS mode.
// Guide resumed from https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-create-multiboot-usb-with-linux
// For the instructions, we assume that the USB is located at /dev/sdb


- We need to configure grub so that we have something that would let us choose between OSs. We will need 2 partitions:
- - One for the partition tables. In EFI mode. This is where we install grub-efi. We need to format this with a fat32.
- - One for the data (the ISO images to be stored). This will be formatter with something that is supported by grub

// This command creates the partition table for msdos on the devices
> sudo parted -s /dev/sdb mklabel msdos

// After creating the partition table, we need the actual partition. Here size is given in Mibibytes. 1MiB=1024KiB (this would be against the 1MB=1000KB)
// 550MiB is the recomended size for the parition
> sudo parted -s /deb/sdb mkpart primary 1MiB 551MiB

// We activate the esp and boot flags
> sudo parted -s /dev/sdb set 1 esp on
> sudo parted -s /dev/sdb set 1 boot on

// Then we create the fat32 filesystem
> sudo mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdb1

// We then created the other partition to hold ISO files and grub configuration files
// We can just use the entire rest of the partition. We set it from the last position 551MiB up to end
> sudo parted -s /dev/sdb mkpart primary 551MiB 100%

// Then we format this new partition to use ext4
> sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb2

// To install grub and put the iso files in place we will need to mount the EFI and data parition somewhere in out system.
> sudo mkdir /media/efi
> sudo mkdir /media/data
> sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/efi
> sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /media/data


- In order to boot in both UEFI and BIOS, we will need to install grub and grub for efi.
// In my case, I don't have grub on my system, so I need to somehow install it
