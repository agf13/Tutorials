A mobile phone calls and messages can be almost easily interceptable

o Intercepting phone calls / messages
- Steps:
- - Get SS7 (Signaling System 7) access
- - Get a valid IMSI
- - Attack


- SS7 is the protocol used to authenticate users mainly in Roaming
\ For example when getting in a new country, the service provider there
\ would reach out to your mobile provider from your country to ask
\ if they are willing to pay for the costs the user will do in their
\ network. This is done over SS7
// Basically to ask if the user is legit

- - In the past, confirming that a line was open for a call involved the playing
- \ of a 2600 Hz sound (which incidentally was the exact sound a flute for cereal
- \ was making). When both parties played the frequency, the connection would be
- \ considered made and the call could start.
// Of course, easily hackable
- \ What is interesting is that when buttons were introduced, they were assigned
- \ Frequencies which were used as actual sounds to recognize the numbers being
- \ pressed.
// ... Anyway
- - SS7 is a global network
- - SS7 provides a GT (Global title) to assess legitimacy of using the network
- - Having access to one GT basically means you have access to all GTs they 
- \ have a partnership with
- - In the past SS7 was pretty secure, as there were only a couple of service providers
- \ for calls and they would trust each other to maintain the security. Nowadays
- \ there are over 1200 operators and 4500 networks, and not every of them is honest.
- \ Some of those operators sell for a couple thousands dolars per month their access
- \ to SS7 (and this is considered as not that expensive). If not, some can be hacked.
[x] ( STEP 1 ACQUIRED )
- IMSI = international mobile subscriber identity (it has 15 digits)
- - Having access to a SS7, requests can be send to other networks
- \ (i.e. the one the target is on) to get the IMSI of the target
- \ Some networks have firewalls for some of the requests.
- \ Basically only the phone number is needed to gain this information

- After all those steps attacks can be started
- - Having IMSI and SS7 access, the calls can be routed to another phone
- \ without the legitimate destination to be in any way prompted or disturbed.
- \ Everything can look perfectly ok for the target.
- \ Even the 2FA messages can be easily stolen.
- \ Or calls can be routed thorugh another party to record them.
