o Incredibly basic unix commands
- cd // change directory. It changed the current location
- ls -la // list all files and folders from current location
- vi name.extension // openes the vile names name.extension from the current location. If not there, then it creates it
- vim name.extension // same as above
// When in vi or vim, it very important:
// When first started, vi or vim is in the "normal mode". Nothing can be inputed here
// Click the "i" key to start editing text. This is the "edit mode"
// Pressing "esc" will put you back in edit mode
// To exit, you need to be in nornal mode and to press ":" "q" "w". Basically is will look ":qw"
// : is for apply followig command, q is for quit, w is for write (save changes)
- sudo command // run the given "command" with super user access. It will request for the admin password.
// On Kali live, both the user and the admin are called "kali"

o zip / unzip
> unzip -d /destfolder zipFile.zip
