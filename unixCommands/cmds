o Incredibly basic unix commands
- man command // opens the manual page for the given command. Exit it by pressing "q". Or a random combination of "esc" and "q"
- cd // change directory. It changed the current location. "cd .." brings you back to the previous folder. 
- ls -la // list all files and folders from current location
- vi name.extension // openes the vile names name.extension from the current location. If not there, then it creates it
- vim name.extension // same as above
// When in vi or vim, it very important:
// When first started, vi or vim is in the "normal mode". Nothing can be inputed here
// Click the "i" key to start editing text. This is the "edit mode"
// Pressing "esc" will put you back in edit mode
// To exit, you need to be in nornal mode and to press ":" "q" "w". Basically is will look ":qw"
// : is for apply followig command, q is for quit, w is for write (save changes)
// To exit without saving, use ":q!". Basically is force quit. 
// To modify something that need priviledged access, use "sudo vim name.extension"
// using CTRL+S while in vi or vim might make the winwod unusable. 
// using name.c will create a c file. It can be compiled, if in the same directory with "gcc -Wall name.c -o name"
// // Where name is the output of the compilation which can be run, if in the same directory, using ./name
- sudo command // run the given "command" with super user access. It will request for the admin password.
// On Kali live, both the user and the admin are called "kali"
- cat name.extension // This will output the contents of the name.extension file in the console
- use CTRL+C when a program does not seem to work or when you want to quit it or when you started something by mistake
- use ALT+F4 when you want to close the current window
- head name.extension // prints the first 10 lines
- tail name.extension // prints the last 10 lines
- watch -n 0.1 "some program or command" // will rerun the command given in "" every 0.1 seconds and will show you the output
- chmod 777 name.extension // Grants all permissions to a file. 7 means rwx.

- - So basically important are
- - - man, cd, ls, vi, vim, cat

o zip / unzip
> unzip -d /destfolder zipFile.zip
// archive

o tar
> tar -xf tarFile.tar -C /destfolder
// might also be without just the "-C" part
// archive
