o Incredibly basic unix commands
- help // opens the help page
- clear // erases all content from the open terminal window
- man command // opens the manual page for the given command. Exit it by pressing "q". Or a random combination of "esc" and "q"
- cd // change directory. It changed the current location. "cd .." brings you back to the previous folder. 
- ls -la // list all files and folders from current location
- vi name.extension // openes the vile names name.extension from the current location. If not there, then it creates it
- vim name.extension // same as above
// When in vi or vim, it very important:
// When first started, vi or vim is in the "normal mode". Nothing can be inputed here
// Click the "i" key to start editing text. This is the "edit mode"
// Pressing "esc" will put you back in edit mode
// To exit, you need to be in nornal mode and to press ":" "q" "w". Basically is will look ":qw"
// : is for apply followig command, q is for quit, w is for write (save changes)
// To exit without saving, use ":q!". Basically is force quit. 
// To modify something that need priviledged access, use "sudo vim name.extension"
// using CTRL+S while in vi or vim might make the winwod unusable. 
// using name.c will create a c file. It can be compiled, if in the same directory with "gcc -Wall name.c -o name"
// // Where name is the output of the compilation which can be run, if in the same directory, using ./name
- sudo command // run the given "command" with super user access. It will request for the admin password.
// On Kali live, both the user and the admin are called "kali"
- rm name.extension // deleted the given file
- - rm -r folderName // deletes a folder. -r means recursive, and need to be given because folder has more files inside
- cp name.extension /path/to/newName // copies the name.extension to the newName file which it will create in /path/to
- - cp -r folder /path/to/newFolder // copies a folder
- mv someName newName // moves or renames the someName to the given newName
- cat name.extension // This will output the contents of the name.extension file in the console
- use CTRL+C when a program does not seem to work or when you want to quit it or when you started something by mistake
- use ALT+F4 when you want to close the current window
- head name.extension // prints the first 10 lines
- tail name.extension // prints the last 10 lines
- watch -n 0.1 "some program or command" // will rerun the command given in "" every 0.1 seconds and will show you the output
- chmod 777 name.extension // Grants all permissions for everyone to a file. 7 means rwx.

- - So basically important are
- - - help, man, cd, ls, vi, vim, rm, cp, mv, cat, clear, head, tail, watch, chmod

o binary
- Just 0 and 1
- Instead of having 731 = 7*10^2 + 3*10^1 + 1*10^0 we have 1010 = 1*2^3 + 1*2^1 = 10
- To find 10 in binary: 10/2 = 5(rest 0), 5/2 = 2(rest 1), 2/2 = 1(rest 0), 1/2 = 0(rest 1) => 10 = 1010

o zip / unzip
> unzip -d /destfolder zipFile.zip
// archive

o tar
> tar -xf tarFile.tar -C /destfolder
// might also be without just the "-C" part
// archive

o parted
> parted /dev/sda mklabel msdos
// not sure how important, it puts the msdos label on the given partition
> parted /dev/sda mkpart primary 1Mib 100%
// this will createa partition from the first Mib to the end of the space from /dev/sda.
> parted /dev/sda rm 
// this will remove a partition. It will ask for the number of the partition. Usually /dev/sda appears when 
// // a usb is inserted. And they will be available /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2, maybe less maybe more.
// // to delete /dev/sda2 you input 2 in the prompt after the rm command
